The learning model for Discovering Management involves 'learning by doing'. The objective is to introduce the students to the relevant topics of the management literature and give them a good introduction in entrepreneurship topics too. The course is a series of lectures on the topics of strategy, innovation, corporate finance, leadership, design thinking and corporate social responsibility. While the 14 different lectures provide the theoretical and conceptual foundations, the experiential learning outcomes result from the interactive business game. The purpose of the business game is to analyse the innovative needs of a large multinational company and develop a business case for the company to grow. This business case is as relevant to someone exploring innovation within an organisation as it is if you are planning to start your own business. By discovering the key aspects of entrepreneurial management, the purpose of the course is to advance students' understanding of factors driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and company success.<br/><br/>Content<br/><br/>Discovering Management aims to broaden the students' understanding of the principles of business management, emphasizing the interdependence of various topics in the development and management of a firm. The lectures introduce students not only to topics relevant for managing large corporations, but also touch upon the different aspects of starting up your own venture. The lectures will be presented by the respective area specialists at D-MTEC.<br/>The course broadens the view and understanding of technology by linking it with its commercial applications and with society. The lectures are designed to introduce students to topics related to strategy, corporate innovation, leadership, corporate and entrepreneurial finance, value chain analysis, corporate social responsibility, and business model innovation. Practical examples from industry experts will stimulate the students to critically assess these issues. Creative skills will be trained by the business game exercise, a participant-centered learning activity, which provides students with the opportunity to place themselves in the role of Chief Innovation Officer of a large multinational company. As they learn more about the specific case and identify the challenge they are faced with, the students will have to develop an innovative business case for this multinational corporation. Doing so, this exercise will provide an insight into the context of managerial problem-solving and corporate innovation, and enhance the students' appreciation for the complex tasks companies and managers deal with. The business game presents a realistic model of a company and provides a valuable learning platform to integrate the increasingly important development of the skills and competences required to identify entrepreneurial opportunities, analyse the future business environment and successfully respond to it by taking systematic decisions, e.g. critical assessment of technological possibilities."},{"_id":"eth;bachelor-computer-science;software-engineering-seminar;3","title":"Software Engineering Seminar","url":"http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=132727&semkez=2019W&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=de","university":"ETH","country":"Switzerland","year":3,"ECTS":2,"category":"seminar","skills":["written communication","presentation skills"],"optional":true,"course":"Bachelor Computer Science","lo":"<br/>The main goals of this seminar are 1) learning how to read and understand a recent research paper in computer science; and 2) learning how to present a technical topic in computer science to an audience of peers.<br/>"},{"_id":"freie-universitaet-berlin;bachelor-informatik;basis-didactics-of-informatics;undefined","title":"Basis didactics of Informatics","url":"https://www.fu-berlin.de/service/zuvdocs/amtsblatt/2014/ab352014.pdf#G2235722","university":"Freie Universitaet Berlin","country":"Germany","category":"communication","ECTS":10,"explicit":true,"skills":["role awareness","self-reflection","ethics"],"course":"Bachelor Informatik","lo":"<br/>Zugangsvoraussetzungen: Erfolgreiche Absolvierung des Moduls Funktionale Programmierung oder des Moduls<br/>Objektorientierte Programmierung für Studentinnen und Studenten mit Programmierkenntnissen oder des Moduls<br/>Objektorientierte Programmierung für Studentinnen und Studenten ohne Programmierkenntnisse<br/>Qualifikationsziele:<br/>Das Modul vermittelt grundlegendes informatikdidaktisches Wissen und Können.

Engineering and architects, as with many scientists and technologists, do not think that they are arguing for an interpretation of the reality or convincing an audience when they write, but believe instead that they are simply conveying data or describing reality. They have this perception because of the epistemologies and ideologies of their disciplinary communities. Even though the engineering and architecture students become more aware of audience and that their writing tasks demand that they convince those audiences, they resist the notion that they are thinking and writing rhetorically, particularly early in their co-op experiences. Examining the writing that architects and engineering produce, the course will aim to underline that their writing is indeed rhetorical – persuasive in that to accomplish work it must change something in the world’s states of affairs – and audience sensitive in that engineers and architects’ relationships with their audiences are interactive and recursive.<br/>The Five Axioms of Engineering Argument (Irish 2016) will be analyzed:<br/>1) A Claim does not stand alone<br/>2) Putting the Claim first is strongest<br/>3) Interpretation is more valuable than analysis<br/>4) Logic is best, but rarely works alone<br/>5) Arguments follow recognized patterns <br/><br/>The outcome of the course is to create a website hosting databases of texts written and collected by students.

These skills will help students to succeed both during their time at University and, more importantly, in their future working life.<br/><br/>Although there are lectures, they do not directly cover topics such as how to build a web-based application.

They need to do these things efficiently, ethically, professionally, and competently, and, often, they need to do them quickly. Although it is possible to learn these skills ‘by osmosis’, this can take years—even decades—of trial and error.<br/><br/>Our goal is to provide students with tools at the start of their degrees that will make them more effective during their university career and, crucially, enable them to work as competent professionals not just when they graduate, but when they do projects and
